# Functions and Libraries

This repository contains files to help you understand about functions and libraries.  The main aims of the session are for you to :

* understand the concept of using a function to decompose your complex programming problem into smaller problems
* to gather sets of functions into libraries
* enable reuse your own code and that of others

Learners will have varying levels of previous experience using functions.  Your primary goal is to complete the early excercise to undersand the concept of a function.  You will gradually use them increasingly through the programme.

There are also more complex excercises for those already quite familiar with functions.

## Files

The first example is based on the file:

`simple_fn.ipynb`

There is a video walk-through of this on Moodle.

The second activity is called `late_penalty.ipynb`
Follow this through and implement the missing functionality.

This also uses a spreadsheet file in the repository with some student marks.
